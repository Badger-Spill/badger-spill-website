# Badger Spill Website

This repository contains source code for the Badger Spill website!

## Project Information

This website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro allows us to compile our site to vanilla HTML+CSS with minimal Javascript (except where required for interactivity). Because Astro compiles into a static site, we can host our generated website for free (and without the need for a server to render our website for users on every visit).

This project also makes use of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a CSS utility library. This allows us to style our website inline without large .css files.

## Project Layout

``src`` - contains the website code
``src/assets`` - contains images that Astro compresses at build time
``src/components`` - contains reusable UI components
``src/layouts`` - folder that contains layouts for the website
``src/pages`` - contains source code for the individual pages on the website
